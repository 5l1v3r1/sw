#### What is pvt.cppan.demo namespace?

'pvt.cppan' is a utility CPPAN account and 'pvt.cppan.demo' contains examples for many projects, but they're not official.

#### Where does cppan download/generate stuff?

By default, in your user home directory. Like `$HOME/.cppan/storage` on *nix or `%USERPROFILE%/.cppan/storage` on Windows.

#### How to change that directory?

Open `$HOME/.cppan/cppan.yml`, add `storage_dir: your/favourite/dir/for/cppan`.
