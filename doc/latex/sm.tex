Goals:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Reliability.
\item
Correctness.
\item
Repeatability.
\item
Robustness.
\item
Scalability.
\item
Performance. This one is mostly provided by language of implementation (C++).
\end{enumerate}

Features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Build System is integrated with Package Manager in one program. This allows us to have more information on both ends. User does not need any external tools except sw itself.
\item
Describe your builds directly in C++(17).
\item
Different frontends. Do not like C++? Write you build configuration in declarative YAML, JSON, Python, LUA and even on good old CMake etc. Currently only basic YAML frontend is implemented. Contributions are welcome.
SW itself is written in modern C++ (C++17).
\item
Easy crosscompilation.
\item
Generators for different IDEs (WIP, contributions are welcome).
\item
Integrations with other tools (CMake etc.).
\end{enumerate}



\section{Drivers}

\section{Frontends}

Main frontend - C++.

Second frontend - CPPAN (v1) YAML-based frontend.

\section{Security}

SW security is based on GPG digital signatures.

TBD
